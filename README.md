# Alphabet-Detection
Alphabet detection identifies and classifies hand gestures representing letters, enabling recognition of sign language alphabets. Using computer vision and deep learning models like YOLO and LSTM, it translates visual inputs into corresponding alphabetic characters for accessibility and communication.
